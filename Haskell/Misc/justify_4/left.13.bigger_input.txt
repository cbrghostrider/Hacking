I've been    
singing with 
my band,     
cross the    
wire cross   
the land,    
I've seen    
every blue   
eyed floozy  
on the way,  
but their    
beauty and   
their style  
went kind of 
moot after a 
while, take  
me to them   
dirty ladies 
every time,  
Fat bottomed 
girls you    
make the     
rocking world
go round.
